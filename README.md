`nxbd` is a lightweight, safety-focused NixOS deployment tool that helps you manage multiple NixOS systems with confidence. It validates your configurations before deployment to prevent common pitfalls and system lockouts.

## Why nxbd?

- **Zero Configuration**: Works with vanilla NixOS configurations - no special code or extra files needed
- **Safety First**: Prevents common deployment issues before they happen
- **Smart Deployment**: Handles complex deployment scenarios automatically
- **System Health**: Built-in monitoring and status checks

### What Problems Does It Solve?

While tools like `nixos-rebuild` handle deployment, they don't validate whether your configuration is safe to deploy. `nxbd` prevents common issues like:

- SSH access lockouts
- Broken sudo permissions
- Wrong system deployments
- Misconfigured critical services
- Disk space waste
- Service configuration errors

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check configuration safety
nxbd check

# Deploy to remote systems
nxbd switch-remote .#server1 .#server2

# Monitor system status
nxbd status
```

## Installation

### Quick Run

```bash
nix run github:applicative-systems/nxbd
```

### Add to flake.nix

```nix
{
  inputs.nxbd.url = "github:applicative-systems/nxbd";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nxbd }: {
    # For your packages
    packages.x86_64-linux.nxbd = nxbd.packages.x86_64-linux.default;

    # Or in your NixOS configuration
    nixosConfigurations.hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        { environment.systemPackages = [ nxbd.packages.x86_64-linux.default ]; }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### Direct Installation

```bash
nix profile install github:applicative-systems/nxbd
```
